        <p>
            I like to do things and stuff; including web-app construction. I also tinker in the physical world with microcontrollers.
            Lately, those worlds are colliding and some <em>things</em> are falling into the <em>web</em>.

            <br><br>I guess what I am trying to say is, Skynet is coming.
